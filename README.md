A personal bot that runs on Discord.

You won't be able to run this more than likely. It requires a cron for a specific script
and a convoluted configuration file. This is mainly here for educational purposes.

In the future the cron job will probably not be required. This requires discord.py version 0.8.0 and will be rewritten for `asyncio` in the future. Until then, good luck running this.
